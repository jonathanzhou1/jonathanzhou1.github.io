                        Brothers, a bond through birth.
                        <br><br>
                        Brother,
                        <br>You always said that you were the older brother, 
                        <br>And I was the younger.
                        <br>You wanted to shield me from the “wind and the rain.”
                        <br>We would be together through the toughest of times,
                        <br>And as one, search for meaning in life.
                        <br>I have you, my older brother, forever in my heart.
                        <br>I also wanted to help you,
                        <br>But I feared the storm.
                        <br>Sunshine in public, and spiteful in private.
                        <br>Why could I never tell you the feelings that I felt?
                        <br><br>
                        Brother, when I was young, I always asked you,
                        <br>“Why were you always the older and I, younger?”
                        <br>I waited.
                        <br>I was never the good one,
                        <br>Why did you never give up on me?
                        <br><br>
                        Brother,
                        <br>I saw you in the rain and wind, facing the storm for me.
                        <br>It was harsh,
                        <br>But why did you never shed a tear?
                        <br>I knew you bled on the inside.
                        <br><br>
                        Brother,
                        <br>I want to stand together with you,
                        <br>I know that you are still human.
                        <br>I have you, my older brother, in my heart,
                        <br>And it is my turn to shield you.
                        <br>I never had the time to tell you the words I wanted to say,
                        <br>The bonds of brothers.
                        <br>The hearts of brothers.
                        <br>The love of brothers.

                        <br>There once was a bird,
                        <br>Trapped in his barred cage.
                        <br>Wistfully looking to the horizon, 
                        <br>Eyes brimming with rage.
                        <br>Evermore now, the bird sleeps, 
                        <br>Dreaming of a better life, one where he was released.
                        <br>Unknown to him, the cage was never locked,
                        <br>He just never tried to flee.
                        <br>But just let him be,
                        <br>Sleeping fitfully in his pain and misery.
                        <br>Unknowing and ignorant, eternally.
                        <br>Let him take safety in his prison, and find comfort in the wind,
                        <br>For freedom is not freely given.
                    </p>

                        <br>
                        I’m no longer who I used to be.
                        <br>I don’t need you anymore.
                        <br>I created you.
                        <br>I don’t want you.
                        <br>You’ve ruined my life.
                        <br><br>
                        Locking yourself away won’t solve your problems.
                        <br>I knew that
                        <br>I thought it was safer inside, but
                        <br>I wasn’t the only thing living in there
                        <br><br>
                        Don’t act like you don’t know me.
                        <br>Don’t treat me like I’m a stranger.
                        <br>Without me, there is no you.
                        <br>You were the one who invited me in,
                        <br>But I’ve been here this entire time.
