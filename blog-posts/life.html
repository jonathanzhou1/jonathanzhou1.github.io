                    <b>The Life of 530 Words</b>
                    <p>
                        <br>Life. Such a fickle thing. So fragile, and yet, once taken away, it can never be returned. 
                        <br><br>
                        Brothers, a bond through birth.
                        <br><br>
                        Brother,
                        <br>You always said that you were the older brother, 
                        <br>And I was the younger.
                        <br>You wanted to shield me from the “wind and the rain.”
                        <br>We would be together through the toughest of times,
                        <br>And as one, search for meaning in life.
                        <br>I have you, my older brother, forever in my heart.
                        <br>I also wanted to help you,
                        <br>But I feared the storm.
                        <br>Sunshine in public, and spiteful in private.
                        <br>Why could I never tell you the feelings that I felt?
                        <br><br>
                        Brother, when I was young, I always asked you,
                        <br>“Why were you always the older and I, younger?”
                        <br>I waited.
                        <br>I was never the good one,
                        <br>Why did you never give up on me?
                        <br><br>
                        Brother,
                        <br>I saw you in the rain and wind, facing the storm for me.
                        <br>It was harsh,
                        <br>But why did you never shed a tear?
                        <br>I knew you bled on the inside.
                        <br><br>
                        Brother,
                        <br>I want to stand together with you,
                        <br>I know that you are still human.
                        <br>I have you, my older brother, in my heart,
                        <br>And it is my turn to shield you.
                        <br>I never had the time to tell you the words I wanted to say,
                        <br>The bonds of brothers.
                        <br>The hearts of brothers.
                        <br>The love of brothers.
                        <br><br>
                        Love. The most formidable power in the universe.
                        <br><br>
                        Beloved,
                        <br>I’ve been lonely for so long, 
                        <br>And it’s still not better.
                        <br>It feels like the whole world is scorning me.
                        <br>I was weak.
                        <br>You always handled it so easily.
                        <br>I think I can feel the taste of the tears now.
                        <br><br>
                        Beloved,
                        <br>Clearly, you loved me very much. 
                        <br>I have forgotten how it felt.			 
                        <br>There are still haunting dreams in the long night. 
                        <br>I better not think about you.
                        <br>When the time comes, 
                        <br>They’ll know how much it hurts.
                        <br><br>
                        Beloved,
                        <br>The happiness then was so captivating.
                        <br>And I just let it go.
                        <br>The dreams that felt like they were coming true…
                        <br>In a blink of the eye, they were all broken.
                        <br>I hope that you are doing well.
                        <br>I’m sorry.
                        <br>I guess I was sentenced forever alone.
                        <br>Unescapable. 
                        <br>You are unforgettable.
                        <br><br>
                        Children. The legacy of the past and the bridge to the future.
                        <br><br>
                        Son,
                        <br>By the time you read this, 
                        <br>I’ll be gone back into the earth that borne me.
                        <br>There were many mistakes I made in my life, 
                        <br>Make sure you do not follow my footsteps.
                        <br>Society may be harsh, 
                        <br>But promise me that you’ll never let your loved one go.
                        <br>In my case, without him, I didn’t want to live.
                        <br>I still regret it to this day.
                        <br>Never forget your purpose in life.
                        <br>If you have not discovered something to die for,
                        <br>Then you are not truly living.
                        <br>My time has ended…
                        <br>I feel it coming… 
                        <br>Sweet relief.
                        <br><br>
                        Death. Some accept it, and some spend their whole life trying to avoid it; and yet they all have one thing in common... eventually, it always catches up with them.
                        <br><br>

                    <p>
                        <br>There once was a bird.
                        <br>He was happy, because he was free.
                        <br>Alas, it was not meant to be.
                        <br>Now, he is trapped in his barred cage.
                        <br>Wistfully looking through to the horizon, eyes brimming with rage.
                        <br>Evermore now, the bird sleeps, 
                        <br>Dreaming of a better life, one where he was released.
                        <br>Perhaps best unknown to him, the cage was never locked,
                        <br>He just never tried to flee.
                        <br>But just let him be,
                        <br>Sleeping fitfully in his pain and misery.
                        <br>Unknowing and ignorant, eternally.
                        <br>Let him take safety in his prison, and find comfort in the wind…
                        <br>For freedom is not freely given.

                        I’m no longer who I used to be.
                        <br>I don’t need you anymore.
                        <br>I created you.
                        <br>I don’t want you.

                        <br>“I thought it was safer inside”
                        <br>“Thought?”
