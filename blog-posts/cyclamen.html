                        <br>The rain pounds down relentlessly. Numbness seeps through my skin, replacing the piercing cold. Lightning flashes in the distance and the thunder rumbles through a second after. How fitting. Light travels faster than sound, so thunder and lightning never intersect. We would climb this hill every weekend and sit on the bench. I know you won’t be here, but the pain lessens a bit every time I come. It’s still inscribed, if you were wondering. I remember, it was a Saturday afternoon, the sunlight streaming through the intricate foliage of the colossal oak behind us, illuminating the leaves around us. I promised you that day that I would wait forever for you. I couldn’t keep my promise then, so just as thunder forever pines after the fleeting flash of lightning, let me keep it now.

                        <div class="text-center">Black Rose:</div>
                        <br>Gray plumes of rancid smoke wafted through the room like a thick cumulonimbus cloud on a mid-December morning. Looking down, I squinted and read the question, ‘What is one plus one?’ The answer was obviously clear in my head, two. Naturally, I wrote down three. Can’t have them thinking I’m smart... no, I stopped being smart years ago. Pausing for a moment, I peered out the window beside me. The glass frame shuttered as an uncontrollable wild wind whirled past. Gray cars creeped past on the gray cobbled road next to the gray field with gray vegetation. Moonlight filtered through the smoggy sky, illuminating the tree on the side of the road. We gave up color a long time ago -- all that’s left are hues of gray. The bell rang. I stood up. I walked out the door into the world of gray.

                        <div class="text-center">Chrysanthemum:</div>
                        <br>A kaleidoscope of red-stained glass shattered through the sunset sky. I remember the last time I saw you. You were out in the backyard in that bright-yellow sundress, watering the marigolds that you cared for so dearly. The Rue you gifted me in my third year is still on my windowsill. Wilted three years ago, but it’s still here -- I couldn’t bring myself to throw it away. I didn’t understand it then, but I do now. I was your only child but I guess along the way you found another. You two were always inseparable. I remember, you said you were proud of me, but you didn’t even know me. Both of us were sitting in the room, talking about the memories of the past we had. Both of us were living in the past, so we took the present for granted. It was too late to change: addiction has always run in the family. The door was already closed, you just locked the gate. So why do I feel like I lost something I never had?
