                        <br>The rain pounds down relentlessly. Numbness seeps through my skin, replacing the piercing cold. Lightning flashes in the distance and the thunder rumbles through a second after. How fitting. Light travels faster than sound, so thunder and lightning never intersect. We would climb this hill every weekend and sit on the bench. I know you won’t be here, but the pain lessens a bit every time I come. I remember, it was a Saturday afternoon, the sunlight streaming through the intricate foliage of the colossal oak behind us, illuminating the leaves around us. I promised you that day that I would wait forever for you. I couldn’t keep my promise then, so just as thunder forever pines after the fleeting flash of lightning, let me keep it now.

                        <br>Gray plumes of rancid smoke wafted through the room like a thick cumulonimbus cloud on a mid-December morning. Looking down, I read the question, ‘When the chromosomes line up in mitosis, this is known as what phase?’ The answer was obviously clear in my head, C - Metaphase. Naturally, I put down A - Telephase. Can’t have them thinking I’m smart... no, I stopped being smart years ago. Pausing for a moment, I peered out the window beside me. Pausing for a
                        moment, I peered out the window beside me. Gray cars raced past, a whirling
                        wild wind on a gray cobbled road which was beside a gray field containing a gray
                        tree with a row of gray bushes. Oh, how captivating! The way the gray clouds
                        appeared to be in contrast to the gray sky. Collectively, the world gave up color a
                        long time ago. We see all hues of black and gray. The bell rang. Instantly, the others filed out the door in a hurried mass of children eager to be
                        free of their previous prison. Bending down, I collected my Biology
                        textbook and shoved it into my gray backpack. Joining the mass of uniforms,
                        I walked out the door into a world of gray.

                        <div class="text-center">Chrysanthemum:</div>
                        <br>A kaleidoscope of red-stained glass shattered through the sunset sky. I remember the last time I saw you. You were out in the backyard in that bright-yellow sundress, watering the marigolds that you cared for so dearly. The Rue you gifted me in my third year is still on my windowsill. Wilted three years ago, but it’s still here -- I couldn’t bring myself to throw it away. I didn’t understand it then, but I do now. I was your only child but I guess along the way you found another. You two were always inseparable. I remember, you said you were proud of me, but you didn’t even know me. Both of us were sitting in the room, talking about the memories of the past we had. Both of us were living in the past, so we took the present for granted. It was too late to change: addiction has always run in the family. The door was already closed, you just locked the gate. So why do I feel like I lost something I never had?
